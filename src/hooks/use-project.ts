/*
  Comparison of State Management Approaches:

  1. Using `useState`:
     - Keeps the state in memory for the lifetime of the component.
     - State is lost when the component unmounts or the page is refreshed.
     - Suitable for temporary state (e.g., form inputs, toggles).
     - Simpler and avoids the overhead of managing local storage.
     - More performant for frequently changing state.

  2. Using `useLocalStorage`:
     - Stores state in the browserâ€™s local storage, which persists across sessions.
     - Useful for data that should remain available after page reloads (e.g., user preferences).
     - Allows retrieval of previously saved data on component mount.
     - Facilitates cross-component sharing of state without prop drilling.

  When to use each:
  - Use `useState` when you only need temporary state that doesn't need to persist.
  - Use `useLocalStorage` when you need to remember user preferences or settings across sessions.
